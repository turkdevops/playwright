## Version 1.17

### Frame Locators

Playwright 1.17 introduces [frame locators](./api/class-framelocator) - a locator to the iframe on the page. Frame locators capture the logic sufficient to retrieve the `iframe` and then locate elements in that iframe. Frame locators are strict by default, will wait for `iframe` to appear and can be used in Web-First assertions.

Frame locators can be created with either [`method: Page.frameLocator`] or [`method: Locator.frameLocator`] method.

```js
const locator = page.frameLocator('#my-iframe').locator('text=Submit');
await locator.click();
```

Read more at [our documentation](./api/class-framelocator).

### Trace Viewer Update

Playwright Trace Viewer is now **available online** at https://trace.playwright.dev! Just drag-and-drop your `trace.zip` file to inspect its contents.

> **NOTE**: trace files are not uploaded anywhere; [trace.playwright.dev](https://trace.playwright.dev) is a [progressive web application](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) that processes traces locally.

- Playwright Test traces now include sources by default (these could be turned off with tracing option)
- Trace Viewer now shows test name
- New trace metadata tab with browser details
- Snapshots now have URL bar

### Ubuntu ARM64 support + more

- Playwright now supports **Ubuntu 20.04 ARM64**. You can now run Playwright tests inside Docker on Apple M1 and on Raspberry Pi.
- You can now use Playwright to install stable version of Edge on Linux:
    ```bash
    npx playwright install msedge
    ```

## Version 1.16

### üé≠ Playwright Test

#### API Testing

Playwright 1.16 introduces new [API Testing](./api/class-apirequestcontext) that lets you send requests to the server directly from Node.js!
Now you can:

- test your server API
- prepare server side state before visiting the web application in a test
- validate server side post-conditions after running some actions in the browser

To do a request on behalf of Playwright's Page, use **new [`property: Page.request`] API**:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('context fetch', async ({ page }) => {
  // Do a GET request on behalf of page
  const response = await page.request.get('http://example.com/foo.json');
  // ...
});
```

To do a stand-alone request from node.js to an API endpoint, use **new [`request` fixture](./api/class-fixtures#fixtures-request)**:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('context fetch', async ({ request }) => {
  // Do a GET request on behalf of page
  const response = await request.get('http://example.com/foo.json');
  // ...
});
```

Read more about it in our [API testing guide](./test-api-testing).

#### Response Interception

It is now possible to do response interception by combining [API Testing](./test-api-testing) with [request interception](./network#modify-requests).

For example, we can blur all the images on the page:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import jimp from 'jimp'; // image processing library

test('response interception', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.route('**/*.jpeg', async route => {
    const response = await page._request.fetch(route.request());
    const image = await jimp.read(await response.body());
    await image.blur(5);
    route.fulfill({
      response,
      body: await image.getBufferAsync('image/jpeg'),
    });
  });
  const response = await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
  expect(response.status()).toBe(200);
});
```

Read more about [response interception](./network#modify-responses).

#### New HTML reporter

Try it out new HTML reporter with either `--reporter=html` or a `reporter` entry
in `playwright.config.ts` file:

```bash
$ npx playwright test --reporter=html
```

The HTML reporter has all the information about tests and their failures, including surfacing
trace and image artifacts.

![html reporter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/138324311-94e68b39-b51a-4776-a446-f60037a77f32.png)

Read more about [our reporters](./test-reporters/#html-reporter).

### üé≠ Playwright Library

#### locator.waitFor

Wait for a locator to resolve to a single element with a given state.
Defaults to the `state: 'visible'`.

Comes especially handy when working with lists:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('context fetch', async ({ page }) => {
  const completeness = page.locator('text=Success');
  await completeness.waitFor();
  expect(await page.screenshot()).toMatchSnapshot('screen.png');
});
```

Read more about [`method: Locator.waitFor`].

### Docker support for Arm64

Playwright Docker image is now published for Arm64 so it can be used on Apple Silicon.

Read more about [Docker integration](./docker).

### üé≠ Playwright Trace Viewer

- web-first assertions inside trace viewer
- run trace viewer with `npx playwright show-trace` and drop trace files to the trace viewer PWA
- API testing is integrated with trace viewer
- better visual attribution of action targets

Read more about [Trace Viewer](./trace-viewer).

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 97.0.4666.0
- Mozilla Firefox 93.0
- WebKit 15.4

This version of Playwright was also tested against the following stable channels:

- Google Chrome 94
- Microsoft Edge 94


## Version 1.15

### üé≠ Playwright Library

#### üñ±Ô∏è Mouse Wheel

By using [`Page.mouse.wheel`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-mouse#mouse-wheel) you are now able to scroll vertically or horizontally.

#### üìú New Headers API

Previously it was not possible to get multiple header values of a response. This is now  possible and additional helper functions are available:

- [Request.allHeaders()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request#request-all-headers)
- [Request.headersArray()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request#request-headers-array)
- [Request.headerValue(name: string)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request#request-header-value)
- [Response.allHeaders()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-response#response-all-headers)
- [Response.headersArray()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-response#response-headers-array)
- [Response.headerValue(name: string)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-response#response-header-value)
- [Response.headerValues(name: string)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-response/#response-header-values)

#### üåà Forced-Colors emulation

Its now possible to emulate the `forced-colors` CSS media feature by passing it in the [context options](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browser#browser-new-context-option-forced-colors) or calling [Page.emulateMedia()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-emulate-media).

#### New APIs

- [Page.route()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route) accepts new `times` option to specify how many times this route should be matched.
- [Page.setChecked(selector: string, checked: boolean)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-set-checked) and [Locator.setChecked(selector: string, checked: boolean)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-set-checked) was introduced to set the checked state of a checkbox.
- [Request.sizes()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request#request-sizes) Returns resource size information for given http request.
- [BrowserContext.tracing.startChunk()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-start-chunk) - Start a new trace chunk.
- [BrowserContext.tracing.stopChunk()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-stop-chunk) - Stops a new trace chunk.

### üé≠ Playwright Test

#### ü§ù `test.parallel()` run tests in the same file in parallel

```ts
test.describe.parallel('group', () => {
  test('runs in parallel 1', async ({ page }) => {
  });
  test('runs in parallel 2', async ({ page }) => {
  });
});
```

By default, tests in a single file are run in order. If you have many independent tests in a single file, you can now run them in parallel with [test.describe.parallel(title, callback)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-describe-parallel).

#### üõ† Add `--debug` CLI flag

By using `npx playwright test --debug` it will enable the [Playwright Inspector](https://playwright.dev/docs/debug#playwright-inspector) for you to debug your tests.

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 96.0.4641.0
- Mozilla Firefox 92.0
- WebKit 15.0

## Version 1.14

### üé≠ Playwright Library

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è New "strict" mode

Selector ambiguity is a common problem in automation testing. **"strict" mode**
ensures that your selector points to a single element and throws otherwise.

Pass `strict: true` into your action calls to opt in.

```js
// This will throw if you have more than one button!
await page.click('button', { strict: true });
```

#### üìç New [**Locators API**](./api/class-locator)

Locator represents a view to the element(s) on the page. It captures the logic sufficient to retrieve the element at any given moment.

The difference between the [Locator](./api/class-locator) and [ElementHandle](./api/class-elementhandle) is that the latter points to a particular element, while [Locator](./api/class-locator) captures the logic of how to retrieve that element.

Also, locators are **"strict" by default**!

```js
const locator = page.locator('button');
await locator.click();
```

Learn more in the [documentation](./api/class-locator).

#### üß© Experimental [**React**](./selectors#react-selectors) and [**Vue**](./selectors#vue-selectors) selector engines

React and Vue selectors allow selecting elements by its component name and/or property values. The syntax is very similar to [attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) and supports all attribute selector operators.

```js
await page.click('_react=SubmitButton[enabled=true]');
await page.click('_vue=submit-button[enabled=true]');
```

Learn more in the [react selectors documentation](./selectors#react-selectors) and the [vue selectors documentation](./selectors#vue-selectors).

#### ‚ú® New [**`nth`**](./selectors#n-th-element-selector) and [**`visible`**](./selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engines

- [`nth`](./selectors#n-th-element-selector) selector engine is equivalent to the `:nth-match` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.
- [`visible`](./selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engine is equivalent to the `:visible` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.

```js
// select the first button among all buttons
await button.click('button >> nth=0');
// or if you are using locators, you can use first(), nth() and last()
await page.locator('button').first().click();

// click a visible button
await button.click('button >> visible=true');
```

### üé≠ Playwright Test

#### ‚úÖ Web-First Assertions

`expect` now supports lots of new web-first assertions.

Consider the following example:

```js
await expect(page.locator('.status')).toHaveText('Submitted');
```

Playwright Test will be re-testing the node with the selector `.status` until fetched Node has the `"Submitted"` text. It will be re-fetching the node and checking it over and over, until the condition is met or until the timeout is reached. You can either pass this timeout or configure it once via the [`testProject.expect`](./api/class-testproject/#test-project-expect) value in test config.

By default, the timeout for assertions is not set, so it'll wait forever, until the whole test times out.

List of all new assertions:

- [`expect(locator).toBeChecked()`](./test-assertions#expectlocatortobechecked)
- [`expect(locator).toBeDisabled()`](./test-assertions#expectlocatortobedisabled)
- [`expect(locator).toBeEditable()`](./test-assertions#expectlocatortobeeditable)
- [`expect(locator).toBeEmpty()`](./test-assertions#expectlocatortobeempty)
- [`expect(locator).toBeEnabled()`](./test-assertions#expectlocatortobeenabled)
- [`expect(locator).toBeFocused()`](./test-assertions#expectlocatortobefocused)
- [`expect(locator).toBeHidden()`](./test-assertions#expectlocatortobehidden)
- [`expect(locator).toBeVisible()`](./test-assertions#expectlocatortobevisible)
- [`expect(locator).toContainText(text, options?)`](./test-assertions#expectlocatortocontaintexttext-options)
- [`expect(locator).toHaveAttribute(name, value)`](./test-assertions#expectlocatortohaveattributename-value)
- [`expect(locator).toHaveClass(expected)`](./test-assertions#expectlocatortohaveclassexpected)
- [`expect(locator).toHaveCount(count)`](./test-assertions#expectlocatortohavecountcount)
- [`expect(locator).toHaveCSS(name, value)`](./test-assertions#expectlocatortohavecssname-value)
- [`expect(locator).toHaveId(id)`](./test-assertions#expectlocatortohaveidid)
- [`expect(locator).toHaveJSProperty(name, value)`](./test-assertions#expectlocatortohavejspropertyname-value)
- [`expect(locator).toHaveText(expected, options)`](./test-assertions#expectlocatortohavetextexpected-options)
- [`expect(page).toHaveTitle(title)`](./test-assertions#expectpagetohavetitletitle)
- [`expect(page).toHaveURL(url)`](./test-assertions#expectpagetohaveurlurl)
- [`expect(locator).toHaveValue(value)`](./test-assertions#expectlocatortohavevaluevalue)

#### ‚õì Serial mode with [`describe.serial`](./api/class-test#test-describe-serial)

Declares a group of tests that should always be run serially. If one of the tests fails, all subsequent tests are skipped. All tests in a group are retried together.

```ts
test.describe.serial('group', () => {
  test('runs first', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
  test('runs second', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
});
```

Learn more in the [documentation](./api/class-test#test-describe-serial).

#### üêæ Steps API with [`test.step`](./api/class-test#test-step)

Split long tests into multiple steps using `test.step()` API:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('test', async ({ page }) => {
  await test.step('Log in', async () => {
    // ...
  });
  await test.step('news feed', async () => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

Step information is exposed in reporters API.

#### üåé Launch web server before running tests

To launch a server during the tests, use the [`webServer`](./test-advanced/#launching-a-development-web-server-during-the-tests) option in the configuration file. The server will wait for a given port to be available before running the tests, and the port will be passed over to Playwright as a [`baseURL`](./api/class-fixtures#fixtures-base-url) when creating a context.

```ts
// playwright.config.ts
import { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@playwright/test';
const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run start', // command to launch
    port: 3000, // port to await for 
    timeout: 120 * 1000, 
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
};
export default config;
```

Learn more in the [documentation](./test-advanced#launching-a-development-web-server-during-the-tests).

```

üëâ  Read more in [Playwright Test documentation](./intro.md).

#### üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Introducing Playwright Trace Viewer

[Playwright Trace Viewer](./trace-viewer.md) is a new GUI tool that helps exploring recorded Playwright traces after the script ran. Playwright traces let you examine:
- page DOM before and after each Playwright action
- page rendering before and after each Playwright action
- browser network during script execution

Traces are recorded using the new [`property: BrowserContext.tracing`] API:

```ts
const browser = await chromium.launch();
const context = await browser.newContext();

// Start tracing before creating / navigating a page.
await context.tracing.start({ screenshots: true, snapshots: true });

const page = await context.newPage();
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');

// Stop tracing and export it into a zip archive.
await context.tracing.stop({ path: 'trace.zip' });
```

Traces are examined later with the Playwright CLI:


```sh
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

That will open the following GUI:
