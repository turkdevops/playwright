## Version 1.15

### üñ±Ô∏è Mouse Wheel

By using [`Page.mouse.wheel`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-mouse#mouse-wheel) you are now able to scroll vertically or horizontally.

### üìú New Headers API

Previously it was not possible to get multiple header values of a response. This is now  possible and additional helper functions are available:

- [Request.all_headers()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-request#request-all-headers)
- [Request.headers_array()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-request#request-headers-array)
- [Request.header_value(name: str)](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-request#request-header-value)
- [Response.all_headers()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-response#response-all-headers)
- [Response.headers_array()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-response#response-headers-array)
- [Response.header_value(name: str)](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-response#response-header-value)
- [Response.header_values(name: str)](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-response/#response-header-values)

### üåà Forced-Colors emulation

Its now possible to emulate the `forced-colors` CSS media feature by passing it in the [context options](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browser#browser-new-context-option-forced-colors) or calling [Page.emulate_media()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page#page-emulate-media).

### New APIs

- [Page.route()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page#page-route) accepts new `times` option to specify how many times this route should be matched.
- [Page.set_checked(selector: str, checked: bool)](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page#page-set-checked) and [Locator.set_checked(selector: str, checked: bool)](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-locator#locator-set-checked) was introduced to set the checked state of a checkbox.
- [Request.sizes()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-request#request-sizes) Returns resource size information for given http request.
- [BrowserContext.tracing.start_chunk()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-start-chunk) - Start a new trace chunk.
- [BrowserContext.tracing.stop_chunk()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-stop-chunk) - Stops a new trace chunk.

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 96.0.4641.0
- Mozilla Firefox 92.0
- WebKit 15.0

## Version 1.14

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è New "strict" mode

Selector ambiguity is a common problem in automation testing. **"strict" mode**
ensures that your selector points to a single element and throws otherwise.

Pass `strict=true` into your action calls to opt in.

```py
# This will throw if you have more than one button!
page.click("button", strict=true)
```

#### üìç New [**Locators API**](./api/class-locator)

Locator represents a view to the element(s) on the page. It captures the logic sufficient to retrieve the element at any given moment.

The difference between the [Locator](./api/class-locator) and [ElementHandle](./api/class-elementhandle) is that the latter points to a particular element, while [Locator](./api/class-locator) captures the logic of how to retrieve that element.

Also, locators are **"strict" by default**!

```py
locator = page.locator("button")
locator.click()
```

Learn more in the [documentation](./api/class-locator).

#### üß© Experimental [**React**](./selectors#react-selectors) and [**Vue**](./selectors#vue-selectors) selector engines

React and Vue selectors allow selecting elements by its component name and/or property values. The syntax is very similar to [attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) and supports all attribute selector operators.

```py
page.click("_react=SubmitButton[enabled=true]");
page.click("_vue=submit-button[enabled=true]");
```

Learn more in the [react selectors documentation](./selectors#react-selectors) and the [vue selectors documentation](./selectors#vue-selectors).

#### ‚ú® New [**`nth`**](./selectors#n-th-element-selector) and [**`visible`**](./selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engines

- [`nth`](./selectors#n-th-element-selector) selector engine is equivalent to the `:nth-match` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.
- [`visible`](./selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engine is equivalent to the `:visible` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.

```py
# select the first button among all buttons
button.click("button >> nth=0")
# or if you are using locators, you can use first, nth() and last
page.locator("button").first.click()

# click a visible button
button.click("button >> visible=true")
```

## Version 1.12

#### üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Introducing Playwright Trace Viewer

[Playwright Trace Viewer](./trace-viewer.md) is a new GUI tool that helps exploring recorded Playwright traces after the script ran. Playwright traces let you examine:
- page DOM before and after each Playwright action
- page rendering before and after each Playwright action
- browser network during script execution

Traces are recorded using the new [`property: BrowserContext.tracing`] API:

```python
browser = chromium.launch()
context = browser.new_context()

# Start tracing before creating / navigating a page.
context.tracing.start(screenshots=True, snapshots=True)

page.goto("https://playwright.dev")

# Stop tracing and export it into a zip archive.
context.tracing.stop(path = "trace.zip")
```

Traces are examined later with the Playwright CLI:


```sh
playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

That will open the following GUI:
